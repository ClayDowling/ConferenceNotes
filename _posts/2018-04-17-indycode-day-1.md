Goals: Make transition easier on the Team, make transition easier on the people doing the transition.

Goal for the new leader: Help the team & the organization become more competent and connected.  Helpful viewpoint: "This is the stamp I will leave on the company and the team."

Being likable and liking the team is valuable.  This contains a dangerous trap: it may cause us to do the wrong thing for the team.

If as a new leader you disapprove of somebody, this is a good opportunity for coaching and improvement of performance.

Trust will improve team performance.  The new leadeer must demonstrate trustworthiness, and extend trust to the team.

Mood of the team will affect the quality of the transition.

Project status
  * Green status, easy transition.
  * Red status, hard transition.  Helpful to look at how you can improve the situation to make an easier transition.

Managing Transition
  The person who is remaining stable in the organization should manage the transition and make introductions.  This could be a senior team member or a supervisor.

Knoster Change Model.  To make a successful transition, must have:

| ---------- | --------------------- |
| Vision     | Confusion             |
